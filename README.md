TypeScript: Enhances JavaScript by adding static types, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
React Query: A powerful data synchronization library for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications.
React Hook Form: A comprehensive and flexible library for managing form state, validation, and submission in React applications.
Server JSON: Utilized for serving JSON files, demonstrating a practical approach to handling static data in a dynamic manner.
IndexDB: A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, offering better performance than localStorage for larger datasets.
